## WorkDash
This is a rewrite of my final project from The Iron Yard. The project was to make a web application that could help you keep track of your work search.

This is a full stack MERN appilcation (Mongo Express React Node)

The search data is from StackOverflow jobs as an RSS feed.


## Libraries Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) to dynamically load content with performance optimizations.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to manage application state.
- [Thunks](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) to do AJAX API calls with Redux.
- [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) for fancy animations.
- [Blueprint](http://blueprintjs.com/docs/v1/) for CSS.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) utility CSS classes only to easily place elements using the padding/margin classes.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
